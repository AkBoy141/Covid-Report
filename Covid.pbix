Greetings,

I am pleased to present a comprehensive COVID-19 report project developed using Power BI. 
Despite being my inaugural project, I successfully completed it within a span of four hours. The project commenced with the upload of the "COVID-19 dataset" into 
Power BI, followed by the creation of a pie chart illustrating COVID cases and outcomes categorized by WHO regions. 
Subsequently, I addressed various queries by generating bar charts, hierarchical representations (utilizing weekly moving averages), and integrating Google Maps functionality. 
For the hierarchical table, I sought assistance from online resources, particularly a tutorial on creating weekly moving averages in Power BI. 
Upon completing the charting tasks, I focused on refining the project's aesthetics, such as modifying the background, theme, emphasizing titles, adjusting axis styling, 
implementing transparency, and selecting distinct color schemes for the pie chart slices.

As the project neared completion, I encountered a challenge regarding sharing via GitHub, as I lacked a Power BI membership and any associated business or student credentials. 
Consequently, I opted to save the project on my OneDrive cloud storage. Following the save, I located the file and proceeded to upload it.

Thank you.

Best regards,
Anuj Grewal
